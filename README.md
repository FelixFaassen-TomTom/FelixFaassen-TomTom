# Biography

Felix has created open data and standards as part of a 20+ year career founding and developing non-profit and commercial products and organizations. He now leads the development of TomTom's Open Source Program Office (OSPO).

Felix has worked for TomTom before (2006 - 2010) where he worked on the early version of TomTom's online service platform for connected navigation devices and real-time traffic services.

In 2010 he co-founded [QuestionMark](https://www.thequestionmark.org/en), an open, independent data platform which goal is to create a movement to accelerate the use and adaptation of sustainable production methods in food production.

Beginning of 2013 Felix co-founded Simacan which develops a real-time supply chain collaboration and visibility platform. As CTO he focussed on strategy and engineering culture and founded the [OpenTripModel](https://www.opentripmodel.org), an open standard for exchanging logistic data on the web.

Before returning to TomTom he worked at the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net) advising governments on how to collaboratively develop, use, maintain and fund open source software.

Felix loves jazz and classical music. He plays piano and loves (analog) synthesizers and composes his own music. When not making music he is enjoying time with his family and enjoying nature in all its beauty and wonder.
